![alt tag](https://github.com/gwena56/wxpyodg/blob/master/howto/img1.png)
# Dependances
- wxPython 3
- Pillow library for Python

# little how to
- use only png image file inside odg (very important)
- In openoffice (See example carpc.odg)
    - do a new odg file sized to a background image (must be the first draw in the odg file)
    - Draw ui element (only rectangle and circle at the moment).
    - double-click on draw to put the name of the element as text.
- Example main.py
